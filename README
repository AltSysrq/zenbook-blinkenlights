Zenbook Blinkenlights
=====================

This is a hackish C program which gives you faux-hardware status indicators for
your Zenbook. In particular,

- The WiFi, NumLock, and CapsLOCK lights are used as a 3-bit battery level
  indicator, the WiFi light being the most significant bit. When battery level
  drops below 6%, all three lights will begin blinking.

- The keyboard backlight is used to indicate CPU usage. It reaches its
  brightest status when the sum of usage across all CPUs exceeds the equivalent
  of one CPU at 75%.

Installation
------------

Edit `/usr/share/X11/xkb/compat/lednum` and â€¦`/ledcaps`
- Change `!allowExplicit` to just `allowExplicit`

Make sure you have `asus-nb-wmi` in `/etc/modules` and loaded.

Compile and install with
```sh
  cc -ozbbld zbbld.c
  sudo cp zbbld /usr/local/bin/
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/zbbld
```

You can then run it with, eg,
```sh
  zbbld &
```

Portability
-----------
This program only works on Linux, and probably will only work perfectly
out-of-the-box if you happen to have the same hardware as I do. Some
modification will probably be necessary if you have more or fewer than 8
virtual CPUs.
